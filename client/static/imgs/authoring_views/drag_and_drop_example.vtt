00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here I'm going to show you how we can create drag-and-drop assessments, which is one of the more complicated assessments.

2
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:11.000
First thing you'll see when you sign into the authoring tool is a very simple navigation structure.

3
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:16.000
And you'll navigate to the folder that matches the subject you're teaching.

4
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm just going to use the English folder -- you may not be teaching English, so you'll have to find your own folder.

5
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.000
This is just our example.

6
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.000
The first thing you'll do is create an assessment using this "new" button in the top right.

7
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
You'll want to give your assessment a very specific name so you can find it later.

8
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:39.000
We'll say "Drag and drop example assessment for help video".

9
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.000
Then you click the "Next" button.

10
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
Once the assessment exists you can then add questions to it.

11
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.000
Here we'll do "cycle of life drag and drop question".

12
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.000
And from the drop down list we'll pick "Drag and Drop".

13
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.000
Then save this question to the assessment.

14
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.000
You'll see this is a fairly complicated screen. There are three sections.

15
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.000
The first is "Prompt" -- the text prompt the students will see.

16
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:11.000
This section is how we manage the background image and different zones, where images can be placed.

17
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.000
And then every image that can be dragged is considered a draggable answer.

18
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.000
So we'll go through how that works.

19
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:27.000
Here we'll say "Drag each image of a frog's life stage onto the cycle of life".

20
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000
So this is the text prompt that students will see.

21
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:36.000
And then here we add a background image. We'll upload it from our computer.

22
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:46.000
And make sure to give it a description and alt tag. Five stage cycle of life.

23
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:56.000
And then for citation / copyright / license for all of the images, you'll have to go by the guidance given to you by CLIx.

24
00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm just filling these fields in to show that you should fill them in.

25
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.000
And then the image will show up here.

26
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:11.000
What you can do is add different zones into the image where students can drag the draggable images.

27
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.000
There are snap zones and drop zones.

28
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:19.000
Snap zones are if you want the dropped images to automatically snap to the center of the zone.

29
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:23.000
In drop zones, the images will not snap to the center of the zones.

30
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.000
We'll just add some snap zones.

31
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:32.000
Once you create it you can drag it and resize the zone.

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You'll want to make sure it covers whatever you think the answer is.

33
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:51.000
We'll add a couple of those -- one for each of the circles in the cycle of life.

34
00:02:51.001 --> 00:03:07.000
Ideally you want to try and not make the zones overlap at all, otherwise the tool will not know which zone an image belongs to if it is dropped in the overlapping region.

35
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:14.000
So we have three, and we need two more.

36
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the last one.

37
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We'll resize this one to also make it cover the whole circle.

38
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:45.000
Once you have these five zones you can start uploading the individual draggable images.

39
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.000
So I have them here.

40
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:52.000
This is an adolescent frog.

41
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then we'll upload them all, and I'll show you how you can create the different matches from the draggable to the answer.

42
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Last two.

43
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And then we'll get one more.

44
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And you'll see that each one of these draggable answers has a drop-down at the top.

45
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:13.000
That's how you match the image to where it's supposed to go on the target image.

46
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:23.000
So the first one is the eggs, and then it should be the tadpole, the little froglet,
and then finally the adult frog.

47
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:28.000
So you'll see they are in order of A, B, C, D, E, which is what the expected order should be.

48
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:35.000
We'll give the students some good feedback, depending on how they answer this.

49
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.000
Once you have everything set, you can preview the question.

50
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:42.000
You won't be able to check whether it's right or wrong. But this is what students will see.

51
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.000
They won't be able to see the zone outlines. You can disable or enable that.

52
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:55.000
They will be able to drag images onto the background images, and they can check to see how this corresponds to the correct answer.

53
00:05:55.001 --> 00:06:00.000
Notice how the images are snapping to the middle.

54
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And that's it for authoring a drag-and-drop question.
